# Output of pipeline. i.e. Total number of processes NOT owned by current user or root:
jof222@tux7:~> top -b -n 1 | tail -n +8 | grep -v "$USER " | grep -v "root " | grep -c -v ^$
141

# Number of processes owned by current user:
jof222@tux7:~> top -b -n 1 | tail -n +8 | grep -c "$USER "                               
8

# Number of processes owned by root:
jof222@tux7:~> top -b -n 1 | tail -n +8 | grep -c "root "
485

# Total number of processes:
jof222@tux7:~> top -b -n 1 | tail -n +8 | wc -l          
633

So, the difference between the two totals is 140. This is close enough for me to say that the 1-process 
discrepancy can be explained by fluctuation of processes running on tux7 in the time between the commands being entered.


# Running the pipeline on the example output of top saved in a file called “test”
jof222@tux7:~> cat test | tail -n +8 | grep -v "makaroff " | grep -v "root " | grep -c -v ^$
93

This produced the expected result.
